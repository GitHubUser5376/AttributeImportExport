# AttributeImportExport
Seemlessly transfer attributes between an external document (csv or txt) and cad software

The "Attribute Export-Import.lsp" file contains the code for importing and exporting attributes from blocks. 
To run this within the CAD software, download the file, then load the file into the CAD application as an 
addin. Consolt other sources on how to install an addin with your CAD software as well as insuring the
software is able to read and run Lisp, ".lsp," files. Once the installation is successful, type "ATHELP" to
see the list of commands this file provides.

Additional notes have been written within the file as additional guides, should they be needed.
